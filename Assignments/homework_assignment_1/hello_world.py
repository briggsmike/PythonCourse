#For fun, I took a couple of takes on this one

#1. Simple, one line. Not very clean in my opinion, but it works.
print("Hello World!\nMy name is Michael Briggs\n\nThis is my first Python program!\n\nHave a nice day.")


#2. Using variables, cleaner. Also trying out the title() method to correctly format a lowercase name
    #first_name = "michael"
    #last_name = "briggs"
    #full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

    #print("Hello World!" + "\nMy name is " + full_name.title() + "\n\nThis is my first Python program!" + "\n\nHave a nice day.")


#3. Using more variables
    #greeting = "Hello World!"
    #intro = "My name is "
    #name = "Michael Briggs"
    #message = "This is my first Python program!"
    #bye = "Have a nice day."

    #One print statment
    #print(greeting + "\n" + intro + name + "\n\n" + message + "\n\n" + bye)

    #Or, broken out
    #print(greeting)
    #print (intro + name + "\n")
    #print(message + "\n")
    #print(bye)
